LL grammar (ε detones en empty string):
=======================================

expr            ->      term termtail

termtail        ->      add_op term termtail  |  ε                       

term            ->      factor factortail

factortail      ->      mult_op factor factortail  |  ε                       

factor          ->      spow spowtail

spowtail        ->      pow_op spow spowtail  |  ε                       

spow            ->      - spow  |  pow

pow             ->      ( expr )  |  function ( expr )  |  constant |  NUM

add_op          ->      +  |  -

mult_op         ->      *  |  /

pow_op          ->      ^  |  **



A note on tails:
================

To get left-to-right evaulation for operators of
the same precedence level (important for e.g. '-' and '/'),
expression like

        a - b - c - d

should result in a tree like this:

                         -
                       /   \
                      -     d
                    /   \
                   -     c
                 /   \
                a     b




A note on power operators:
==========================

Should power operators be evaluated left-to-right, or
right-to-left?  Different languages/math environments do it differently:

        right-to-left: x^y^z = x^(y^z) : python, fortran, awk, R,
                                         scilab
        left-to-right: x^y^z = (x^y)^z : octave, Matlab

Right-to-left seems to be more common, and I feel we should
follow common conventions. OTOH, there are still a few
environments that do it left-to-right, so it's not a very strong
convention, and since we evaulate other operators left-to-right,
I feel we should do it for power operators as well.  So we do it
left-to-right.
